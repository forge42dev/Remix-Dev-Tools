react-router-devtools is an open-source package designed to enhance your development workflow when working with React Router v7+, a full-stack JavaScript framework for building web applications. This package provides a user-friendly interface consisting of three tabs, **Active Page**, **Terminal**, **Settings**, **Errors**, **Network** and **Routes**, along with a side tab called **Timeline**. With react-router-devtools, you can efficiently monitor and manage various aspects of your React Router v7+ projects, including page information, URL parameters, server responses, loader data, routes, and more.


You can also track down hydration issues with the **Errors** tab and view your routes in a tree/list view with the **Routes** tab.


**Network** tab is a powerful tool for tracing all your network requests and see what's happening under the hood. You can see all the requests in real-time, with the ability to see if they are aborted, if they are cached, and if they are successful or not.

### Remix Development Tools

This repository used to be called remix-development-tools, but we decided to rename it to react-router-devtools to better reflect the fact that it's a package for React Router v7+ and not just for Remix.

If you're looking for the old version of this package, you can find it [here](https://github.com/forge42dev/Remix-Dev-Tools/tree/remix-development-tools).

And the detailed documentation can be found [here](https://remix-development-tools.fly.dev/).

## Getting Started

1. Install the package via npm:

```bash
npm install react-router-devtools -D
```

```js
import { reactRouterDevTools } from "react-router-devtools";

// Add it to your plugins array in vite.config.js
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [reactRouterDevTools(), reactRouter(), tsconfigPaths()],
});
```

That's it, you're done!

### CloudFlare

If you're trying to spin it up on CF, try adding this to your `optimizeDeps` in your `vite.config.js` file:
```ts
optimizeDeps: {
  include: [
    // other optimized deps
    "beautify",
    "react-diff-viewer-continued",
    "classnames",
    "@bkrem/react-transition-group",
  ],
},
```

In loving memory of my late Grandfather, who taught me to always be curious, never stop learning, and to always be kind to others, and my late Grandmother who always encouraged me to learn new things, and stand up for the things I believe in.
