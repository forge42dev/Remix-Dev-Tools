## Plugins in Vite
Plugins work in a different way in Vite. You create a directory for plugins and just provide the path to the directory to the plugin. The plugin will automatically import all the plugins from the directory and add them to the dev tools. You only need to make sure your exports are named exports and not default exports and that they are uniquely named.

You can create a directory called plugins in your project and add your plugins there. Then you can add the following to your vite.config.js file:
```ts
import { remixDevTools } from "remix-development-tools/vite";
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    remixDevTools({
      pluginsDir: "./plugins"
  })],
});
```

## Plugins in Remix bundler (v3 only)
Writing plugins for Remix Development Tools is easy. You can write a plugin that adds a new tab to the Remix Development Tools in the following way:

Create a new file in your project called remix-dev-tools-plugin.tsx
Implement your jsx component and add the logic you wish to add to the Remix Development Tools.
Export a function with the following contract:
```tsx
  const MyComponent = () => {
    // Implement your logic here
    return <div>My Component</div>
  }

  export function remixDevToolsPlugin(yourOptions?: { ... }): JSX.Element {
    return {
      // can't be page, terminal or routes, must be unique
      id: "my-plugin",
      // Name that is shown in the tab next to the icon
      name: "My Plugin",
      // Icon to be shown in the tab
      icon: <MyIcon size={16} />,
      // The component to be rendered when the tab is active
      component: <MyComponent />,
      // Whether the timeline should be shown on the tab
      hideTimeline: false,
    }
  }

```

Import it in your root.tsx file and pass it to your Remix Development Tools:

```diff
import { remixDevToolsPlugin } from "./remix-dev-tools-plugin";

-  withDevTools(App);
+  withDevTools(App, { plugins: [remixDevToolsPlugin()] })
```

You should now see your plugin in the Remix Development Tools as a new tab.
