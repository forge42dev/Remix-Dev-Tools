## Installation
Adding React Router Devtools to your project is easy. First install it into your project by running:

```bash
npm install react-router-devtools -D
```

This will install it as a dev dependency in your project.

## Enabling the tools

After you have installed the tools, you need to go to your `vite.config.ts` file which will probably look something like this:

```ts
import { reactRouter } from '@react-router/dev/vite'
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import tsconfigPaths from 'vite-tsconfig-paths'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [reactRouter(), tsconfigPaths()],
})

```

All you have to do is add the plugin into the `plugins` array in your `vite.config.ts` file.

```diff
import { reactRouter } from '@react-router/dev/vite'
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import tsconfigPaths from 'vite-tsconfig-paths'
+import { reactRouterDevTools } from "react-router-devtools";

export default defineConfig({
-  plugins: [reactRouter(), tsconfigPaths()],
+  plugins: [reactRouterDevTools(), reactRouter(), tsconfigPaths()],
})

```
<Warn title="Warning">
Make sure your plugin is BEFORE the react router one!
</Warn>

**That's it!**

You should now see the React Router Devtools in your browser when you run your app.
